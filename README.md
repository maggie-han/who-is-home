An RFID door lock for you and your roommates, plays a little tune when someone comes home

### but why
My roommates and I move around every 4 months thanks to our coop/school schedule. I became a little concerned over the number of people who had the same keys before us ( 5 people * 3 terms a year = 15 every year). Changing new locks every term is unrealistic. I came across these magnetic locks that are really easy to install. So why not use an arduino and use RFID tags to unlock the door?

### what does it do
Every roommate has an unique identification code and their corresponding RFID cards. They can use their card to unock the door, which also plays a little tune annoucing "welcome home, _____"

### security?
Use your own keycode, use your own ID code, place your circuits behind the door and hide the wires xD

An RFID door lock for you and your roommates, notifies others when someone gets home (with a little tune in MP3 shield or with text messages)

### Why
My roommates and I move around every 4 months thanks to our coop/school schedule. I became a little concerned over the number of people who had the same keys before us ( 5 people * 3 terms a year = 15 every year). Changing new locks every term is unrealistic. I came across these magnetic locks that are really easy to install. So why not use an arduino and use RFID tags to unlock the door?

### What does it do
Every roommate has an unique identification code and their corresponding RFID cards. They can use their card to unock the door, which sends the homeowner a text on who has arrived home. Alternatively, plays a corresponding mp3 audio for the user

### Security?
Use your own keycode, use your own ID code, place your circuits behind the door and hide the wires xD
